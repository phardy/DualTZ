# TODO

* Either replace TZ text with customised font, or own bitmapped images.
* Despite how I configure the minute and hour hand updating, it seems
  to happen regularly: minute hand shifts every ten seconds no matter
  what. Does that mean it's refreshing every tick?
* Possible race condition during the delay on location detection.
