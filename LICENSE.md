This project uses code from a few different sources with different licenses.

* common/PDutils.h and common/PDutils.c contain functions from
  [PDPCLIB](http://pdos.sourceforge.net/), the Public Domain Project
  C Library. I've made very minor changes to these functions to work with
  Pebble OS, and have released these back to the public domain.
* I've included an unmodified copy of the
  [timezonepicker](https://github.com/quicksketch/timezonepicker/]
  jQuery timezone picker library. There's no license specified in this
  library. I hope they don't mind me including it.
* The font, [Digital-7](http://www.styleseven.com/php/get_product.php?product=Digital-7) is freeware.

All other code is provided under the MIT License.
